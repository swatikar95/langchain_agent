# langchain_agent
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of LangChain to set up an agent capable of performing specific tasks, such as calculating the length of a given text. The agent uses a combination of LangChain's prompt templating, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and custom-defined tools to iteratively process queries and generate responses.
